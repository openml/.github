### üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Who are we?
OpenML aims to democratize machine learning by creating an open, frictionless platform for accessing and sharing datasets, models, and experiments. Anytime, anywhere. It allows scientists to easily build on each other's work, learn from the past, and automate their workflows. [Check our website to learn more](https://new.openml.org/).

### üåà Contribution guidelines
If you are new to OpenML, please see our [general contribution guide](https://new.openml.org/contribute#help). We're so happy that you want to help!
We are open to anyone getting involved, and are always seeking to increase diversity in AI.
